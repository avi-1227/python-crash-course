# if-else statement
'''
Often, you'll want to take one action when a conditional test passes and a different action in all other cases. Python's if-else syntax makes this possible.
An if-else block is similar to a simple if statement, but the else statement allows you to define an action or set of actions that are executed when the conditional test fails.
